# CapCutHelper
A Windows batch script designed for CapCut users to automate finding and opening the latest `combination` folder in CapCut’s project directory (`com.lveditor.draft`). Includes a tutorial to create and preprocess Compound Clips (subprojects) using CapCut’s free features, enabling users to export professional-grade edited clips without a CapCut Pro subscription.

## Features
- **Automated Folder Search**: Locates the most recently modified `combination` folder where Compound Clip data is stored.
- **Built-in Tutorial**: Guides you through creating Compound Clips to export edited clips using CapCut’s free tools, achieving results comparable to Pro features.
- **Cost-Free Export Workflow**: Leverages CapCut’s free Compound Clip feature to export high-quality clips, bypassing the need for Pro-only export options.
- **User-Friendly**: Displays a step-by-step tutorial before opening the folder in Windows Explorer.

## Tutorial
Follow these steps in CapCut to create and export Compound Clips using free features:
1. Open CapCut.
2. Select all edited clips (Hotkey: Ctrl+A).
3. Right-click on any clips and select "Create Compound Clip (Subproject)" (Hotkey: Alt+G).
4. Right-click on the compound clip and select "Pre-process Compound Clip (Subproject)".
5. Wait for processing to complete.

The script then finds and opens the latest `combination` folder containing the processed clip data.

## Limitations
